Welcome to lexicographR, an alpha prototype created by Ligeia Lugli and Tilak Balavijayan at the Mangalam Research Center (MRC), thanks to the NEH-funded project [Democratizing Digital Lexicography ( HAA-290402-23)](https://figshare.com/collections/Democratize_Digital_Lexicography/7207656/1). 
lexicographR stems from MRC's lexicographic program, the [Buddhist Translators Workbench](https://www.mangalamresearch.org/buddhist-translators-workbench/), where we are developing the first corpus-driven dictionary of Buddhist Sanskrit literature. Creating a Buddhist Sanskrit corpus and using it to curate a dictionary is not an easy feat, especially on a tight budget. We have been working on this for a long time and have picked up a few tricks along the way. lexicographR is our way to share with you what we have learned and to put it to the service of all lexicographers working in low-resource settings. The pipelines we have created for our Sanskrit dictionary were generalized and refined thanks to the NEH-funded project Democratizing Digital Lexicography.

lexicographR is designed to help with three main tasks involved in the creation of digital dictionaries:

1. Augment pre-existing dictionary data with information extracted from corpora (e.g., frequency/dispersion information, collocations, and examples) and data visualization (representing either information extracted from the corpus, e.g., collocations, or curated information taken from the dictionary, e.g., graphs of word senses).

2. Design an interface for a digital dictionary (to display pre-existing dictionary data, corpus-derived data, or a mixture of both) and automatically produce the code to render the dictionary on a web browser, which can easily be deployed online.

3. Convert pre-existing dictionary data, potentially augmented with corpus data, to the machine-readable and interoperable JSON-LD format.

The flowchart to the right summarizes the recommended lexicographR workflow.
